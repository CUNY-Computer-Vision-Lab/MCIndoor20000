# MCIndoor20000
## a fully-labeled image dataset to advance indoor objects detection
<p align="justify">A fully-labeled image dataset provides a unique resource for reproducible research inquiries and data analyses in several computational fields, such as computer vision, machine learning and deep learning machine intelligence. With the present contribution, a large-scale fully-labeled image dataset is provided, and made publicly and freely available to the research community. The current dataset entitled <strong>MCIndoor20000</strong> includes more than 20,000 digital images from three different indoor object categories, including <strong>doors</strong>, <strong>stairs</strong>, and <strong>hospital signs</strong>. To make a comprehensive dataset regarding current challenges exist in indoor objects modeling, we cover a multiple set of variations in images, such as rotation, intra-class variation plus various noise models. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at https://github.com/bircatmcri/MCIndoor20000.</p>

### Value of the Data
+ The MCIndoor20000 dataset collected in Marshfield Clinic, and it presents various digital images of three guideline indoor objects, including clinic signs, doors and stairs.
